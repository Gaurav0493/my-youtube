 ## Instructions for the assignment
* Clone this repo on your machine.
* Use your IDE of choice to complete the assignment.
* When you are done with the solution and have pushed it to the repo, [you can submit the assignment here](https://app.snapcode.review/submission_links/45b970fe-dda2-4920-a23b-49b5c3ecc42b).
* Once you indicate the completion, your access to the repository will be revoked. Do make sure that you have finished the solution and pushed all the relevant code to the repo.

## Problem Statement
Create a webapp in which auser can search for a video using the YouTubeAPI. 
Feel free to use React, Vue, Angular or any other well-known web framework.
Web app should let users:
* Search for videos via keywords.
* It should show a list of matching results with video image/thumbnail and title of the video (Feelfree to add more info).
* It should also have infinite scrolling.
* Feel free to make it awesome by using your creativity.

#### Youtube API

* Use your google account to get the API key
* Docs: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docsRules: 

#### Rules
* You are to create SPA using ReactJS/AngularJS/VueJS.
* Usage of external UI libraries such as Bootstrap, Material, Ant design etc is not allowed.
* Create your own CSS or style object for UI.
* Submitted code must build & run on Linux platforms.
* Submitted code will be reviewed for both functional and non-functional requirements such as code quality, ease of setting up it on local, testing scripts, etc.
* Your submission will be rejected if the test cases are missing.
* Responsive UI, PWA, hot reloading, minification etc will be a plus point.
* Don’t spend too much time on setting up the build i.e. webpack config or stuff like that. Feel free to use build tools like create-react-app, angular-cli, vue-cli to setup up a project.

#### How do I submit ?

When you are done with the solution and have pushed it to the repo, [you can submit the assignment here](https://app.snapcode.review/submission_links/45b970fe-dda2-4920-a23b-49b5c3ecc42b)

#### How do we evaluate ?
**Simplicity**: We value simplicity as an architectural virtue and a development practice.Solutions should reflect the difficulty of the assignedtask, and should not be overly complex.Layers of abstraction, patterns,or architectural features that aren’t called for should not be included.

**Self-explanatory code**: The solution you produce must speak for itself. Multiple paragraphs explaining the solution are a sign that it isn’t straight forward enough to understand purely by reading code, and are not appropriate.

**Tests**: Should be around the requirements and not around code. Eg. tests should read like “Searching for cat should result in cat related videos” instead of “Click on search button calls onClickhandler” - Basically avoid testing implementation details and focus on testing functionality.
